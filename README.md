I've updated the README to include details about this project specifically targeting Digimon World 1 for the PlayStation 1. Here's the revised version:

# Digimon World 1 Decompilation Project

This project aims to decompile and reverse engineer Digimon World 1, a classic PlayStation 1 game, into readable and potentially compilable C code.

## Project Overview

The main focus of this project is to recover and translate the original PlayStation 1 game code of Digimon World 1 into modern C, making it more accessible for study, modification, and potential porting to other platforms.

### Key Features

- **main.c**: Designed for use with PSX.DEV extension in Visual Studio Code
- Utilizes Ghidra for initial pseudo-C code generation
- Ongoing translation of pseudo-C into compilable C code
- **SLUS_010.32.c**: Contains pseudo C code output by Ghidra, specifically for the PlayStation 1 version of Digimon World 1

## Tools Used

- **Ghidra**: Used for disassembly and initial pseudo-C code generation of the PlayStation 1 game binary
- **Visual Studio Code**: Primary development environment
- **PSX.DEV Extension**: Provides PlayStation 1 development support in VS Code

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Contains the main game logic, tailored for PSX.DEV and PlayStation 1 architecture
- `SLUS_010.32.c`: Pseudo C code generated by Ghidra from the original PlayStation 1 game binary
- Other source files: Various game components and functions specific to Digimon World 1
- Documentation: Explanations of reverse-engineering process and code structure

## Methodology

1. Disassemble the original PlayStation 1 game binary of Digimon World 1 using Ghidra
2. Generate pseudo-C code through Ghidra's decompilation engine
3. Manually translate and refine the pseudo-C into compilable C code, preserving PlayStation 1 specific features
4. Organize and structure the code to match the original game's architecture
